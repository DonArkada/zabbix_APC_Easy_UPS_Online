# Zabbix template for APC Easy UPS Online (SRV2KRIRK) with AP9601 network card

As when installing this UPS I couldn't find proper template I had to create own.

I was trying my best to map proper ids onto values but I can't tell it's 100% correct.

Only identified discrepancy is in temperatures. Temp shown on LCD is different than temp mapped.
I'm explaining like the temp on LCD is UPS temp while fetched one is strictly battery temp.
